Kaggle digit recognizer (MNIST) comptetition. (http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

## Competition Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

## Solution

You cand find the code and notebook in repository. Code is developed on Kaggle notebook with GPU Enabled. Pytorch and CNN is used for solution.

## Result

Accuracy is 0.99385
